## APIs

Sources of data and connections to external systems.

## Feeds
Feeds can be realtime (built from a live data source) or historical (built from CSVs)

## Aggregators
Aggregators consume feeds, deploy some AggregatorFunction across the data, and emit that data to subscribers

## Strategies
Strategies consume data from various aggregators and emit Signals based on those aggregations

## Portfolios
Portfolios consume Signals from a strategy (or more?) and take actions based on those Signals. They report results back to the strategy, and report metrics for analysis. 

## Metrics
Metrics are generated by portfolios. They are used for analysis and plotting. 

## Open questions
- For historical mode, is the current row-based approach for generating price feeds going to align well with data coming from the aggregators?

## TODO
- [] create a strategy that can call a python endpoint or a network endpoint to get a prediction
- [] create a training orchestrator that can take a strategy, train it, and then deploy it
-
